issues I experienced when compiling cpp files contained a lot of header files, since I am playing around competitive programming these days.
If some files not found.

like: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include/bits/c++config.h:586:10: fatal error: 'bits/os_defines.h' file not found
#include <bits/os_defines.h>
         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.




Steps: 1. Install homebrew in macbook
       2. Using brew install g++
       3. cd /usr/local/bin
       4. ln -s g++-11 g++
       5. And ls, you will find g++ is created.
